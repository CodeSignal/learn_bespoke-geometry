# Example App

This directory contains a reference application that demonstrates Bespoke layout and design system components. It showcases a simple interactive counter using buttons, inputs, dropdowns, tags, and other components to illustrate Bespoke usage patterns. Open it at `http://localhost:3000/example-app/index.html` when the development server is running.

This example is for reference and testing only. You can keep it to explore the design system or remove it if not needed.
